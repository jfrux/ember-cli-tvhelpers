# ember-cli-tvhelpers

The goal of this project is to gradually bring in useful functionality from the Microsoft/TVHelpers library and make it usable in Ember.
As of right now, it has not been tested in production.

## Installation

```sh
$ ember install ember-cli-tvhelpers
```

## Todo

- [ ] Inject all tvjs modules into the page source using Ember.
- [ ] Allow overrides to which libraries to include within your ember-cli-build.
- [ ] TBD. Create a service to access any relevant API's
- [ ] TBD. Determine and implement helpers / components that make sense for Ember.
- [ ] TBD. There may be use for a Windows.UI service, but may be a separate addon.

## Running Tests

* `npm test` (Runs `ember try:each` to test your addon against multiple Ember versions)
* `ember test`
* `ember test --server`

## Building

* `ember build`
